## About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that make a real impact. My work spans from distributed systems to LLM integrations, always focusing on performance, reliability, and user experience.

## What I Do

My expertise lies at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence. I build:

- **AI-Powered Applications**: From code review bots to intelligent automation systems
- **Real-Time Systems**: Collaborative platforms with sub-100ms latency
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Scalable Kubernetes deployments optimized for cost and performance

## Technical Skills

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust
**Frontend**: React, Next.js, Canvas API, WebSockets
**Backend**: Node.js, Express, FastAPI, GraphQL
**AI/ML**: OpenAI API, LangChain, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
**DevOps**: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB

## Philosophy

I believe great software is:
- **Performant**: Speed matters - users notice every millisecond
- **Reliable**: Systems should be boring (in a good way)
- **Maintainable**: Code is read more than written
- **Impactful**: Technology should solve real problems

## Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Contributing to open source projects
- Writing technical blog posts
- Exploring new AI models and tools
- Hiking and photography
