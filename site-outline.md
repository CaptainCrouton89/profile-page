Projects Featured: Co-GM, Mystica, Sales Application (the compoze labs app, give it a better name), .claude/klaude dev tools (give it a better name), cosmicnotes (real name is Mercury Notes).

Then, have the sales app (it was for a company called the Sales Dream, but we need client anonymity) link to "more client work" page. That page should have the rest of my client work at agencies.

I also need a timeline on my about page. The timeline should link to case studies or client work summary page. The timeline should probably be its own page. 

I'm thinking:
- case studies page (grid of all projects, shows featured projects with links to their dedicated pages)
- who I am page - includes all the information about who I am, philosophy, etc. Seamlessly links to other stuff maybe where relevant?
- Client Work page — one page, dedicated just to work at agencies. No external links to dedicated pages except for the compoze labs work, which has its own case study
- timeline—idk how to feature this, but I want it artfully integrated and with links.

Main page: interactive chat with ai version of me. It should have access to all my data/case studies/etc, and should give users links to them.
